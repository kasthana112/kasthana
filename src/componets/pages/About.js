                Welcome to Kanika Asthana's Portfolio!
                I was raised in Chicago suburbs and currently live in the west loop. I was previously in the Supply Chain Logistics Industry. After much reflection, I realized that 
                I wanted to take my career in a different direction. Technology has always been a passion of mine and with the direction of the world I think this is a wonderful journey to embark on. 
                I'm extremely excited to start my career as a full-stack developer and always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow my skills.
